# Advanced Capabilities Checklist

This checklist separates what now exists as a foundation in the repo from what still needs full product-grade implementation.

- [ ] Sidebar tree, breadcrumbs, tabs, and command palette
- [ ] Drag-and-drop between blocks, tables, and files
- [ ] Presence and multiplayer collaboration
- [ ] AI-assisted editing, summarization, and generation

## 7. Recommended build order

1. Go FAST: remove runtime JSX parsing, lower render allocations, and harden routing/state hot paths
2. Go PAINT: bind `pkg/vibe` into GoUIX and GoScript components with real canvas / spatial rendering
3. Go IRT: add realtime event, sync, and collaboration flows for modules and workspaces
4. Go Jetpack: add deeper profiling, benchmark, and diagnostics loops around render and routing performance
5. Add `pkg/i18n` integration to routing, rendering, and UI direction
6. Build a workspace UI layer on top of `pkg/workspace`
7. Implement inline table views and file browser components
8. Add collaboration, syncing, and AI editor workflows
